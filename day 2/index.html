	<h2>Advent of Code - Day 2</h2>
	The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. 
	They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.<br /><br />
	Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. 
	The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.
	<br /><br />For example:
	<ul>
		<li>A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.</li>
		<li>A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total <b>square feet of wrapping</b> should they order?
